# house-price-prediction

In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from houses. This study utilizes machine learning algorithms as a research method. House price prediction can help determine the selling price of a house and can help to arrange the right time to purchase a house. There are various factors that influence the price of a house which include physical conditions, concept and location.
